libsqlite4java-custom
---------------------
This is a fork of the sqlite3 java wrappers from here:

* http://code.google.com/p/sqlite4java/

I recommend you go to that project for anything real.  I created this project because the default build of sqlite was not sufficient and I found the build system to be a little too brittle to do what I wanted.  In the custom/ directory is a custom and build file that builds a custom jar and binary.

Again, this is for my own uses.  Others are recommended to see the original project.
